This is a C++ project that like any other requires you to have a compiler of your choice, in my case I used a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) where I installed and used Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS for its compiling and development. This is a OOP project that uses inheritance, polymorphism, operator overloading, references as well as many other concepts.

It also divides in 3 parts:
- Each class has its own .cpp and .h files
- A main.cpp file
- The text file that cointains the movies and episodes in a special format

  # Text File Format:

  Movies:
